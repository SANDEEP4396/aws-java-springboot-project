An AMI contains the operating system, application server, and applications for your instance.
If you don't see a suitable AMI below, use the search field or choose Browse more AMIs.

Once the instance is created we SSH into it to connect to the VM. Securely connect to the remote server.
We need secret Key Pair -> Create it while creating instance.

Security rules:
Rule list to access the server. Provides the entry point to the application. I.e Ports,
SSH -> Port number 22
HTTP -> Port number 8080
These acts like two doors. Basically a group of rule acting like firewall to access the APP.
